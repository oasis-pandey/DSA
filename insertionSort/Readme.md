# Insertion Sort Implementation

## Overview
This project implements the **Insertion Sort** algorithm in C++ to sort a vector of integers. The Insertion Sort algorithm works by iterating through the array and inserting each element into its correct position relative to the sorted portion of the array. The sorting is performed in-place without using additional memory.

## Files
- **`insertion_sort.h`** - Header file containing the function prototype and documentation.
- **`main.cpp`** - program to demonstrate the Insertion Sort function.

## Usage
1. Include the `insertion_sort.h` header file in your program.
2. Call the `insertionSort` function by passing a vector of integers.
3. The function will sort the vector in ascending order and print the sorted array.

## Example
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include "insertion_sort.h"

int main() {
    std::vector<int> arr = {3, 2, 7, 4, 10, 1};
    insertionSort(arr);
    return 0;
}
```

## Output
```
1 2 3 4 7 10
```

## Complexity Analysis
- **Best Case:** O(n) (Already sorted array)
- **Average Case:** O(n²)
- **Worst Case:** O(n²) (Reverse sorted array)
